# coin_machine_v1

This coin machine is a fun project I've been thinking about building for a long time. I suppose I don't have a real good reason I wanted to do it besides I thought it was interesting. Here's how it works. A user inserts a coin, it goes down the chute into a two sided rectangle. It flips open, the camera takes a picture. It flips back over and the camera takes another picture. Then it's released and the user can insert another coin again. There is a trapdoor that opens if a user inserts too many coins and there's a light indicating when they can insert another coin. To start, it just saves the coins picture but eventually, I'd like to have the pictures be able to recognize what the coin is and if it has any value.
