Total Time Spent ~ 20 hrs


7/20/2025 -- 1.5 hours

Forgot to update this yesterday but I'll go ahead and do this now. I started to work on the cad for the actual flipper that will open up and allow the coins to take the images. It essentially works by having two magnets that hold it shut when it's not being pried open by the bar in the main rectangular tube. These act as the bottoms so the coin doens't fall down the chute prematurely. The actual "cading" wasn't too hard but I had to go back several times to make adjustments on the sizing. I also sketched out the rest of the box and started to create a bom. I'll attach an image of the sketches that I made yesterday

7/21/2025 --3 hours

Continued to build out the chute on the cad as well as the bom. The bill of materials has been harder than I originally thought as finding the correct parts and then making sure that the schematic and 3d orientation will work correctly all togethor is nothing short of a pain in the butt. Additionally, when building out the chute, I couldn't figure out how to get it to go along on the path that I wanted it to go on. I looked it up on chat gpt, google, reddit, etc and nothing worked. Eventually, I just created it using the sweep and then extruded a cut so that the one end would be flat 90 degrees but there has to be a better way of going about that.

Created all of the symbols and built out the schematic. This was a HUGE pain in the butt, but kinda fun at the same time. The good news is that it sort of paid off to go through all the bill of materials was correct the first time. I had to consult with chat gpt and google a lot when building out most of the schematic as I'm fairly novice in this work. In terms of efficiency, I feel like 4-5 hours for working on a schematic isn't that bad especially for someone who hasn't done it a ton like me.

7/24/2025 - 5 hrs

Started to build out the actual box and rest of the components via fusion360 to finish up the project. This should have gone a lot easier then it did. Despite the fact that I had all the pieces with the correct heights and dimensions on them, the pieces were still really finnecky when going into place. Eventually, I looked up a manual for fusion 3690 and realized that you can do point to point connections which turned out to be a life saver. Will finish the rest of the cad by tomorrow. 

7/25/2025 - 1 HR

Again, I continue to work on the project. Today, I had a huge setback as I realized the chute ran into the servo. WHAT A PAIN. So, I took some time to extrude another 3.6 millimaters to the end of the chute and then extended the rest of the infastructure (flipper, main rectangular thing, side exterior coin holder, etc) so that all of that would work with the new dimensions that i worked with.

Finished everyhting up!!! The final github uploads and downloading all the content wasn't a whole lot of fund but Ican feel how ready I am to start building it out!
